CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

This is an awesome idea that will be very useful for system
administrators and users alike.  It could be used to reorder
tasks and processes which may need to operate at different
priorities for different applications.

This is similar to another project, but different enough that
both teams can claim originality for their ideas.  I'm excited
to see what develops with this!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
