Comments:
---------
I laughed out loud at "goForDinner()" ~~ very inventive!  I don't think the
code is actually doing a synchronized situation, though.  It looks like you
are just forcing things to go in order, but that may just be due to the code
of the resource hierarchy method.  The sync stuff is harder in "C", so I give
you kudos for attempting it in that language!!

I edited your mmapTester.txt file and added an X at the end.  Your program
found it, so that works fine!


Nice work!
